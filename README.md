# Kickstarter_Trends



1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
•	Projects with goals of raising $1000 to $4999 do the best and this range is the most common goal. Surprisingly, projects ranging from $40000 to$ 49999 found more success than failure. 
i.	There were 1425 Kickstarter with the goal of $1000 to $4999, next 722 projects with the goal of $5000 to $9999, then there is 461 kickstarts hoping to raise less than $1000, but then the next in number of kick starters was for the goal of greater or equal to $50,000. I would have assumed that the higher the goal, the less kick starters. 
•	Kickstarter campaigns to fund theatre, specifically plays, has the most success, followed by music. Quickly scanning the data, most campaigns were created 2016, and I’m curious if there’s any correlation between the number of campaigns and the decrease of funding allocated towards the performing arts in public education. Documentaries seem to do pretty well too. 
•	Faith and Jazz music are not too popular among the donors. All jazz music kick starters failed! People are more willing to fund rock music. 
•	All animation projects failed!
2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	There’s only three months of live data. 
3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
•	Duration of campaign vs. # of backers, Status, % funded to see if longer campaigns raise more funds or if there are other factors, such as the category/sub-category  of project, advertising, 
•	Country/Locality of the project’s origin would be interesting to investigate to see if where the project is effects funding, # of backers, how much funding is needed, and also what kind of projects are coming from where. 
•	Of the successful projects, are there more backers with low average donations. 
•	Which category has the most/least backers, with the highest/lowest avg. 

Statistical Analysis
	Successful Outcome	Failed Outcome
Mean	194	18

Minimum	1	0
Maximum	26457	4
Variance	712841	3773
Std. Dev. 	844	61






Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

Considering the size of the dataset and the amount of outliers, the mean is more meaningful than the medium. In the successful outcome, there is a huge leap in backers from 8,359 to 20242, followed by the highest number of backers at 26,457. In the Failed outcomes, 287 of the projects had zero backers with only one project acquiring more than 1,000 backers. 

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
There is more variability in the successful campaigns if you look at the variance and standard deviation, but they seem a bit high. I’m not entirely sure they are accurate. There are more backers for successful campaigns, but most successful campaigns have a lower goal.
